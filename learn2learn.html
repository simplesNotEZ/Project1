                        Check out one way that I Clear The Stage here:

                    <p>
                        In order to learn effectively, it is a good idea to "Set the Stage".  The first part of this process involves clearing the stage.  To me this basically means setting up your work-station or learning-environment . For the learning session that I am referencing, here are some things that I did to clear the stage:  my room in the house I am living is my best spot to learn.  This is the place with the least amount of distractions in the house.  I am out of the normal flow of activity.  I have a couple different fans in the room that I can utilize to drown out background noise.  If these are not enough, I have earplugs.  I have a spot for my computer cleared at my desk.  I have a comfortable chair.  I've used the restroom.  I have a drink on-hand.  To help clear the stage on my computer, I recently learned how to add multiple desktops.  This enables me to separate and distill down the tabs of my Chrome browser, so that I only have open the tabs required for the project at home.  (Please refer to my screen recording to see my two different desktops.)                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to do as part of setting the stage is  to clarify the 'what' and 'why' of what I will be learning.  I actually didn't do great with this before the actual session.  Looking back on it now, I realize that.  So, I did some research today (4/30/18) on Flexbox to figure out the 'why' behind this learning session.  So, the 'what' of the session was--familiarizing myself with Flexbox properties and values.  The 'why' was--Flexbox CSS styling is an alternative to using the float property to format items within a container.                    
                    </p>    
                    <p>    
                        After the 'what' and 'why', the last aspect of setting the stage is to remind yourself to prioritize process over the project.  This means to remember that dutiful focus and practice with your learning is the point.  The point is not to be perfect and not to perfectly understand. Submitting yourself to the process of learning is what counts when learning.                   
                    </p>                    
                    <h4>Play
                    </h4>
                    <p>   
                        The second aspect of Learning to Learn (L2L) is 'Play'.  This involves trying things out from several different vantages, failing on purpose,  being curious, and having fun.  The reason "the experts" say this helps with learning is the observation that children learn at a much faster rate than adults.  Apparently, this comes from their approach to learning--they play.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing the rubric for this drill mentions is how your setting of the stage might influence your play for the session.  I'm just starting to think about this.  Does this mean that I should include a slinky at my work-station.  I guess that maybe it does.  Another idea might be to have something at my work-station that manipulates my mood in such a way that I'm reminded to be in a playful mood--putting up a picture of Chris Farley maybe.  Of course, if distractions are minimized, you will be more apt to be available for play.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflect
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Reflection is the third major step in the process of L2L.  I often cut this step out.  Some of the reflection hinges on your process of learning during the session.  Another aspect of reflection is on the actual what and why that you were learning.  Good questions to ask during this stage: What were my objectives? How far did I get? How much is left? How was the process? Did I set the stage well? Did I play well? What can I do better next time?                  
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Again, as the rubric reminds, also ask yourself: what do I wanna do next with this technology?  For this learning session, for this last question, I would answer:  I would like more experience with both floating and flex-boxing, and it would be best to use these separately but with the same content.  This way, I can compare and contrast the two approaches easily.

                        Setting the Stage is important because it increases your productivity when you work.  It is recognizing that there are certain conditions under which you work best.  So, since I know myself better than anybody else, I need to identify what conditions I work best under.  What are distractions to me?  What do I need in order to work most efficiently?  I need to set myself up for success.   This encompasses a lot of things.                   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For today's learning session, here are some things I've done to set my stage:  
                        --Went to bed at a reasonable hour last night;
                        --Left at a reasonable time this morning in order to arrive at Galvanize on time;
                        --Picked a study spot where distractions to me were minimized;
                        --Readied a beverage;
                        --Used the restroom;
                        --Brought my computer charger;
                        --Organized my application windows with the Spectacle application;                 
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        Another part of setting the stage is explicitly stating what I am learning and why I am learning it.  Here:            
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What am I learning? DOM Manipulation       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why am I learning this?  Manipulating the DOM is a skill of high importance, because it enables you to make your webpages dynamic.  Your webpage can be altered in appearance and "act" and "react" through DOM manipulation.  This makes your webpage more interactive and responsive.  This, in turn, makes your web page more usable and more engaging.  This is important because you want your user to enjoy their experience when on your page and you want your webpage to be able to respond in ways that a user will natively want it to respond.

                        The second aspect of Learning to Learn (L2L) is 'Play'.  This involves trying things out from several different vantages, failing on purpose,  being curious, and having fun.  The reason "the experts" say this helps with learning is the observation that children learn at a much faster rate than adults.  Apparently, this comes from their approach to learning--they play.

                        How can I "play" with DOM manipulation?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One way that I tried to do this for this session was to watch a funny youTube clip.  I thought that this might help to put me in a more playful state-of-mind.  It is important for me to remind myself that being in a playful mood is important when learning.  If I'm only trying to get something checked off of a list, then I will not be as apt to try appraoching the subject from different vantages.  Plus, I have to remind myself that it's okay to mess up.  In fact, failing on purpose might actually assist me in learning.  Learning doesn't always occur in a linear fashion.  There will be mistakes made--aka failures.  There will be set-backs, challenges, and moments of frustration.  That's okay; that's even good--a sign that learning is actually occuring.
                    </p>                   
                    <p>
                        So, in playing around with DOM manipulation, I reminded myself that error messages were okay.  I am reminding myself right now that though I set up my Drill A of DOM manipulation wrong, that it's okay.  That was just part of learning.
                    </p>                   
                    <p>
                        Also, in learning some of this DOM manipulation, I played around by attempting to use different methods that might do the same thing.  I used setAttribute and then watched what happened.  Then, I used classList.add and watched what happened.  I tried adding just one class.  Then, I tried adding two classes at once.  This trial-and-error kind of approach is a way to "play".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One way in which play is enhanced or influenced is by how you set your stage.  I would say that part of setting one's stage is setting one's mind right.  So, when I watched a funny youTube clip, that was setting my stage in a way that might enhance my playability.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflect

                    <p>
                        Reflection is the third major step in the process of L2L.  One thing that is frustrating me is that I feel like I never have time for this step.  I guess I feel like it's not an important enough step to use what limited time I do have on it.  This is definitely something that will require me being disciplined about. It will feel uncomfortable for me to do this for a while, especially at first.  I will need to practice at it.  So, I will have to admit that I did not keep my objectives in mind during this learning session.  I was just working away at understanding enough to get the particular step in the drill done.  I wasn't thinking about the bigger picture:  why is getting the drill done important.  And, I suppose that I didn't really set my stage correctly then, because I didn't explicitly state to myself at the outset of the session why I was learning what I was attempting to learn.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another good reflection question:  How can I "play" better next time?  One of my cohorts yesterday reminded me of the console.logging method of "playing".  Console.logging helps with the "playing" approach because it helps you to better see how your "playing" is influencing your coding better, in a more step-by-step fashion.  I want to better utilize console.logging the next study session that I have.  I still have more DOM drills to do, so I will have plenty of opportunity to improve at this.  What else is something I can try next time?  If I add a class, I can try to do the opposite and remove a class.  If I create an element, I can try to delete an element too.  In the future, I would like to use DOM manipulation in conjuction with one of my html projects.

                    <p>
                        Check out one way that I set-the-stage here: 
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/nRJMfQZQvS0">
                            YouTube Video
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay, the first thing I'm going to do to set my stage for this session--take a break.  I've been working for over an hour on some other stuff.  I can feel the need to take a break bubbling up.  So, in order to decrease this mounting anxiety, I will take a break now...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Okay, I'm back from my break.  This makes me wonder about what makes a break effective for me.  I think for me, an effective break includes: getting a change of scenery, moving around--as in, getting out of my chair, maybe closing my eyes, maybe listening to some music, and definitely maybe thinking about something totally different than whatever I'm working on.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Another thing that is part of my setting the stage is tidying up my work area.  So, toward this end, I cleared away my empty coffee mug.  I also relocated a marker that was in my work area that I didn't need any longer.  Further, I stacked up my notebooks instead of leaving them loosely strewn.  Having a tidy workspace helps me.  It minimizes distractions.  If there are several items within my viewing landscape, my eyes and therefore brain are more apt to wonder.  Plus, these extraneous items just lend to my brain feeling spread thin over all these items.  I don't learn as well with a thinly spread brain.  I need all the brain cells I can get.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        To further set the stage, let me state what I will be learning and why I will be learning this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What am I learning?  DOM manipulation
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why am I learning DOM manipulation?  DOM manipulation helps to make a webpage more interesting and more interactive.  Events that occur on the page can change how the page is displayed and can change what the page does.  A more interactive page engages the user more and a more interactive page can be more functional for a user.  And, if we aren't catering to users then our pages are just an exercise in onanism (self-gratification).                   
                    </p>
                    <h4>Play
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In this second DOM learning session for me, I'd like to use console.log a lot more.  It's not necessarily play per se, but I think it will make my playing, my fiddling with the code to see how it works, much more effective.  I will be more easily able to see how my alterations of the code affect it.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Another aspect of play, besides just trying things out, is approaching a learning session from several different vantages.  I did this for this session by watching a video of an old DOM Breakout.  What I also did was to burn-and-rebuild.  This served my learning of DOM manipulation by giving me different perspectives on this one subject.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, I set out with the object of learning how to manipulate the DOM.  By working within the Tic-Tac-Toe drill, I was able to manipulate the DOM by creating elements, adding attributes, adding text with the textContent method and so on.  How far did I get?  Well, I did rewrite all of the code of DrillA, so as far as meeting the coding requirements of the drill, I finished.  If I wanted to though, I feel like I could learn more about DOM manipulation and the game logic by using console.log() some more within the code of this drill.  There's always more to practice and there's always more to learn, deeper to drill, as it were.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the playing went really well this time.  I really focused in on trying different things, changing things, just seeing what worked and how things worked.  Using console.log() was invaluable for this kind of play to work.  Using console.log() helped to better familiarize me with the Web Developer Tools in Chrome too.  I would like to learn some more of the tricks with those in the future.                   
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        What didn't go well?  It did take a lot of time.  I think I spent at least two-and-a-half hours with this.  I feel like it was time well-spent.  As developers,and heck, as humans, 
                        we need to always be aware of how much time we are spending on something, because there is always a cost to spending time on something.  The cost is that there is less time to do other things. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I think that in the future, it might help to decide ahead of time exactly how much time is wise to put in to a given learning session.
                        Part of setting-the-stage today involved getting my Chrome Developer Tools opened up.  This way I could see my console.logs.  And, as described above, console.logging is helpful with play.
                        In the future, like I said in my last Learn 2 Learn, I wanna use DOM manipulation to enhance an html project.  Plus, I am sure that I will be using console.log() from here on out in the future.
