                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am compelled to make things and then enliven them with functionality. I want to help to get things done well with style while providing a comfortable experience for the user. Web Development is an ideal environment to achieve these ends.</p>
                <p> I have a variegated history of experience in other fields more focused on service and as working as part of team to deliver positive outcomes for clients. I think this will equip me well for working in a development environment. I like the complexity of Web Development and the way in which several disparate skills, approaches, and fields must be considered and woven into a unifying visible and workable product.</p>
                <p>In my free-time, I like to try to improve on pretending that I can skateboard, to read books from across the spectrum, and to go for walks in pretty much any setting--there is something to see and learn in everything, even in ugliness.</p>
                <p>In the upcoming months I will be searching for a job in full-stack web development where I can wield my skills in technology, user-experience, and creativity to produce compelling and useful products for companies that I believe in.</p>

                <h3>Learning to Learn</h3>
                <p>At Galvanize, a primary focus is on the habits and mindsets of good software developers and inculcating these into its students.  In the software development world, new technologies arise constantly and it behooves a good developer to learn about these new technologies.  So, being able to learn is part-and-parcel of being a software developer.  This is why it is so important to Galvanize to teach it's students to learn to learn, to teach its students the right habits and mindsets to be successful beyond Galvanize. Galvanize believes that learning to learn is a process comprised of three different facets: Setting the Stage, Playing, and Reflecting. Read about some of my experiences learning to learn.</p>

                <h3 class="goals">Goals</h3>
                <p>Besides being able to learn effectively and being able to solve problems, setting effective goals will be crucial as a successful software developer.  Setting effective goals can increase productivity by 11-25%.  Galvanize believes that for goals to be effective, they need to be S.M.A.R.T. goals.  That is, goals need to be: Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely. Read more about some specific practice I got in making SMART goals.</p>

                <h3 class="meetups">Meetups</h3>
                <p>Another major emphasis at Galvanize is the development of a robust network.  Software engineers need a firm base from which to get help, share ideas, and find out about the right opportunities that are out there.  Meetup.com offers some great resources in this vein.  Check out my experiences with some of these Meetups.</p>
