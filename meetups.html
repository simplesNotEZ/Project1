                        Name1: Roger

                        Job Information: Data Scientist at RTD.  He considers himself back-end and uses SQL.

                        Job Information: UI Technician at Hawaiin Airlines.  He uses angular a lot.  He acquired his first job in development by meeting somebody at a Meetup event.

                    <h4>What I Learned:
                    </h4>   
                    <p>    
                        The content of the presentation was largely over my head.  The presenter, Adam, did a great job though.  He proved knowledgeable and competent.  I learned that he is not a big "hot-key"/keyboard-shortcuts utilizer.  Also, he was nervous about others watching him code and type. (This probably is a very common reaction that most coders have.) I think it may have been his first time presenting or at least in this format or with this content.  There was a co-worker sitting in the front-row giving him encouragement throughout. 
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        One thing that was surprising to me was how readily people approached me to talk.  I thought that I might have to initiate the conversation, but not all of them.  And, when I did initiate, the people I approached were very ready to chat.  I found that encouraging. 
                    </p>

                        Job Information: Senior Developer for a start-up company.  Sean works remotely.  He is the project manager for a start-up company in L.A.  He used to live in L.A. and formerly worked with this same group of individuals on another, now defunct, project.  After he moved back to Denver, these individuals recruited him to work on another project.

                    <h4>What I Learned: 
                    </h4>  
                    <p>
                        I actually met a friend of Mr. James Mann's--Brent.  Brent was the drummer of James' band while on cruise ships.  Brent is teaching himself to code.  He goes to a bunch of meet-ups.  He offered the idea of going to meet-ups to learn to code better, not just to network.  He finds that going to meet-ups with less people is better, for him at least, for learning to code and work on code.  When there are less people, he finds that more work is able to get done.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also learned some interesting tid-bits about working remotely from Mr. Sean Williams.  He misses being able to interact with co-workers "in real life" instead of through virtual connections.  He has shared office space with individuals that do different kinds of work, just for the ability to have real-life human interactions with people.  So, working remotely has its disadvantages as well as its perks.

                        Three of us from Galvanize were talking with Shannon.  Actually, Shannon approached us.  He flat-out told us that he had observed that often at Meetup events, people just talk to the people they already know.  He was frustrated with that, so he made it a point to initiate with people he did not know.  This kind of motivated me to push myself to go talk to people that I didn't know.  This wasn't necessarily a new idea to me, but it did reinforce the idea for me.  Additionally, it helped me by "nudging" me to do the same. 
                    </p>     
                    <p>
                        When we were describing Galvinize to Shannon, we told him about Galvanize's emphasis on teaching us to be good learners as learning on the job is crucial in the development milieu.  Shannon told us that he had to teach himself how to do his job.  He said that there wasn't any training for him on the technology that he would be using for his job.  His company just gave him his log-in information to the several different technologies that they used and then set him loose.  I think in software development, the need and willingness to learn quickly is probably more crucial to the job than in other fields; however, the need to learn new stuff on-the-fly is present in many other fields as well.

                    <p>
                        Later, I talked with Johnny and Avi.  These two fellas had a city of Denver map and a laptop open.  They were working together on a bike-maps project.  It was Avi's brain-child and Johnny was helping him because of his expertise in transportation.  Johnny has a master's degree in transportation engineering.  Specifically, Johnny was a big help to Avi because of his knowledge of Geo Services Information (GSI).  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These two guys just happened to be at the brewery.  They didn't know anything about the Meetup.  This taught me that if some persons are at a bar with a lap top open, they might just be working on a project and people are always happy to talk about their projects with others.  Furthermore, I don't think either of them were web developers.  Avi does have a website, but it didn't sound like he was a developer.  I would like to look him up on LinkedIn to find out more about this.  Perhaps he will be needing the assistance of a developer??? 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Questions I Have:
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        1.  If I had to choose:  practice stuff in coding or go to a Meetup, what would serve me better in terms of getting a job?  I suppose there is always a balance that needs to be struck, but these Meetups are very good resources for learning about job opportunities.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        2.  One person I talked to, Beth M., was a project manager.  Her main concern at the moment was that her team did not have enough developers.  Her dilemma:  Is it worth it to hire more developers at this time, in order to grow and get more work done, or does she need to reserve resources for now and stick with the team they have?  What are some of the other challenges of being a project manager?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.  What are some of the things that GSIs do, beyond the obvious?  How are they being implemented in the web development world?
