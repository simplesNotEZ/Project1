                        1.  Complete Learning to Learn (L2L) Drill A by the end of the day.

                    <p>
                        2.  Create a channel in youTube in order to link to a screen recording for L2L Drill A by the end of the day. (This goal serves goal 1.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.  Make a screen recording with audio of one way clear the stage by the end of the day. (This goal serves goal 1.)
                    </p>    
                    <p>    
                        4.  Start on Drill A of "Set simple short-term goals" and complete as much as possible on that by the end of the day.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        5.  Start on "Attend Meetups" Drill A before the end of the day, to prepare myself for my first venture a a Meetup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.  Start on "Build multi-page websites" Drill A before the end of the day.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Reflection 5/1/18:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Were the goals met? (Yes or No) Yes, all goals were completed by the end of the day (5/1/18).
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        What went well? (The student describes at least 2  successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.') Honestly, everything went well today. I was worried  about setting up a youTube channel and creating a screen recording, as I have never done these before. Both of these    tasks were much easier to complete than I had anticipated.     And, because the goal of finishing Drill A of the L2L stuff was contingent upon these two tasks being completed, once I had those done, completing Drill A of L2L was a cinch. There's three 'wins' right thur.
                    </p> 
                    <p>   
                        What didn't go well? (The student describes at least 1 action   that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.) The most I can say about this deals with starting Drill A of the "Building Basic Websites Unit". It's been a while since   I've written up html for a whole site. I had to recall some nearly-bygone info from the recent past. It wasn't a clean and total recall. I had to look some stuff up and look off of the  html of other products to refresh my memory. However, my goal was only to start Drill A; it wasn't to be completely comfortable and flawless in doing-so. Thus, I still feel like I  met this goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What will you do differently tomorrow? Tomorrow I will have different goals, obviously, since today's were all completed. I don't know that there is a whole lot to do differently. Fortunately, I didn't encounter any blockers today. I know that     today probably went more smoothly than most days will transpire. Thus, I won't hold onto the unreasonable expectation that things will always go so smoothly.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Were the goals met? (Yes or No)
                        My goals were mostly met.  I didn't practice "Spectacle" keyboard shortcuts for a full 30 minutes--only for 19 mins.
                    </p>   
                    <p>
                        What went well? (The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.')
                        Practicing the "Spectacle" shortcuts really did help me with maneuvering open windows to where I want them to be.
                        Working on my first basic website was fun; that's why I consider it a "win".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What didn't go well? (The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.)
                        Practicing the "Spectacle" keyboard shortcuts for thirty minutes was a goal-unmet.  It was too mind-numbing to do   for a straight 30 minutes.  I started with a 16 minute    session, then took a break.  I later did a three-minute    session.  By that time, I think I had topped-out on as much    time as I could spend during one day on this stuff.  I may     have just sufficiently learned them and didn't really need  more practice, within that day at least.
                    </p>      
                    <p>
                        What will you do differently tomorrow? 
                        I will try the spaced-repetition method for practicing keyboard shortcuts. This way, I won't get too burnt on practicing this mind-numbing process.

                        What went well? (The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.')
                        I think everything went pretty well today. I completed all my goals. I had the most fun working on the javaScript(JS) fundamentals drills.  It was good to practice on those in order to refresh my memory on JS stuff.  I also made some good progress on my Website-3.  I think I am becoming more proficient with Flex-Box.

                        What didn't go well? (The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met.)
                        I did run out of time in class to complete all my goals. I needed to work some after class to finish getting enough time working on my Website-3.  This is why I use the   wording "by the end of the day" and not "by the end of class".  Most nights I try to work     on some stuff at home, after class.

                    <p>
                       What will you do differently tomorrow? 
                       I will remain conservative in divying up my time between tasks.  It's easy to get    ambitious and alot too much time to tasks than there is in a day. It's good to be  conservative in an effort to allow for break time and time to assist other individuals,in case someone is seeking help from me.
